# CS131: Programming Languages

## Parsing, Part 2

In this lecture, we will delve deeper into parsing and explore advanced concepts such as parser combinators, parameterized types, and the Maybe type. Parsing is a fundamental aspect of programming languages, as it involves checking for syntax errors and constructing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) when the syntax is correct.

### Let's Build a Parsing Library!

To understand the purpose of a parser, we first need to grasp the distinction between syntax and semantics. Syntax refers to what the programmer writes, usually represented as a sequence of characters (text or strings). Semantics, on the other hand, deals with the meaning behind the syntax. In Haskell, the syntax is defined using data types, and the semantics are captured by an evaluation function written in Haskell.

When implementing a parser, there are several approaches we can take. We can build the parser from scratch manually, utilize an existing parsing library, employ a parser generator that compiles a syntax description to parser code, or use a parser synthesizer that generates parser code based on examples of valid and invalid programs. In the CS131 course, which focuses on compilers, we explore these different techniques and delve into ongoing research in the field.

### Parser Combinators

We begin our exploration of parsing techniques with parser combinators. A parser combinator is a higher-order function that takes one or more parsers as input and returns a new parser as output. These combinators allow us to create complex parsers by combining simpler parsers together.

To illustrate this, let's consider a simple example. Suppose we want to parse a digit in a string. We can start with a basic parsing function called `digit` that checks if the first character in the string is a digit. If it is, we return a success result along with the remaining portion of the string; otherwise, we return a failure result.

```haskell
digit "" = (False, "")
digit s@(c:cs) =
  if isDigit c
    then (True, cs)
    else (False, s)
```

Now, instead of defining separate parsing functions for digits, letters, and spaces, we can create a more general function called `getCharThat` that takes a character condition as an argument and returns a parsing function. This function abstracts away the common pattern of checking a specific condition on the input character.

```haskell
getCharThat _ "" = (False, "")
getCharThat cond s@(c:cs) =
  if cond c
    then (True, cs)
    else (False, s)
```

By leveraging the power of function composition, we can define parsing functions for digits, letters, and spaces more concisely.

```haskell
digit :: ParsingFunction
digit s  = getCharThat isDigit s

letter :: ParsingFunction
letter s = getCharThat isLetter s

space :: ParsingFunction
space s  = getCharThat isSpace s
```

### Composing Parsers

With basic parsers in hand, we can now combine them to build more complex parsers. Parser combinators allow us to express sequential parsing (`p1` then `p2`) and alternative parsing (`p1` or `p2`).

Let's consider the example of parsing a letter followed by a digit. We can define a parsing function called `letterThenDigit` that uses the `letter` parser, followed by the `digit` parser, and returns the result. If both parsers succeed, we continue parsing with the remaining portion of the string; otherwise, we return a failure result.

```haskell
letterThenDigit "" = (False, "")
letterThenDigit s = 
  case letter s of
    (True,

 s') -> digit s'
    (False, _) -> (False, s)
```

Similarly, we can define a parsing function called `digitThenLetter` that parses a digit followed by a letter.

```haskell
digitThenLetter "" = (False, "")
digitThenLetter s = 
  case digit s of
    (True, s') -> letter s'
    (False, _) -> (False, s)
```

To further generalize the process of combining parsers, we can define a combinator `<&&>` that takes two parsing functions, `p1` and `p2`, and returns a new parsing function. The resulting function attempts to parse with `p1` and, if successful, continues parsing with `p2`. Otherwise, it returns a failure result.

```haskell
(<&&>) :: ParsingFunction -> ParsingFunction -> ParsingFunction
(p1 <&&> p2) s =
  case p1 s of
    (True, s') -> p2 s'
    (False, _) -> (False, s)
```

Another type of combinator we can utilize is the alternative combinator `<||>`. Given two parsing functions, `p1` and `p2`, it tries to parse with `p1`. If `p1` fails, it then attempts to parse with `p2`. This combinator enables us to express choices in parsing.

```haskell
(<||>) :: ParsingFunction -> ParsingFunction -> ParsingFunction
(p1 <||> p2) s =
  case p1 s of
    (True, s') -> (True, s')
    (False, _) -> p2 s
```

### Repetition and Skipping Whitespace

In addition to sequential and alternative parsing, we often encounter scenarios where we need to repeat a parser multiple times. To address this, we can define combinators for repetition. The `many` combinator takes a parsing function `p` as input and returns a new parsing function that attempts to parse `p` repeatedly until it fails. The result is a list of successful parsing results.

```haskell
many :: ParsingFunction -> ParsingFunction
many p = (p <&&> many p) <||> psucceed
```

Similarly, the `some` combinator ensures that at least one successful parse is required. It combines `p` with `many p`, enforcing that `p` must succeed at least once.

```haskell
some :: ParsingFunction -> ParsingFunction
some p = p <&&> many p
```

Whitespace is often irrelevant in many programming languages, so it's helpful to have a mechanism to skip over whitespace automatically. We can define a `skipws` combinator that takes a parsing function `p` as input, and returns a new parsing function that skips over any whitespace before attempting to parse with `p`. It achieves this by using the `many` combinator with the `space` parser.

```haskell
skipws :: ParsingFunction -> ParsingFunction
skipws p = many space <&&> p
```

### Parsing Arithmetic Operations

To demonstrate the power of parser combinators, let's consider the grammar for arithmetic expressions.

```
Expr ::= Factor + Expr
       | Factor - Expr
       | Factor * Expr
       | Factor / Expr
       | Factor
Factor ::= number
         | (Expr)
```

We can write parser code that mirrors the grammar itself, thanks to the flexibility provided by parser combinators.

```haskell
expr =  (factor <&&> sym '+' <&&> expr)
   <||> (factor <&&> sym '-' <&&> expr)
   <||> (factor <&&> sym '*' <&&> expr)


   <||> (factor <&&> sym '/' <&&> expr)   
   <||> factor

factor =  number
       <||> (sym '(' <&&> expr <&&> sym ')')
```

With these parser definitions, our parser code directly resembles the grammar it is parsing. It can detect parse errors and abstract away the complexities of parsing using combinators.

However, it's worth noting that creating the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) can still be challenging initially. Building up the AST and abstracting the code requires additional effort and understanding of the underlying structure of the language.

## Parameterized Types

### Recall: Lists are Parameterized Types

Lists in Haskell are examples of parameterized types. The cons operator, `(:)`, has the following types for its arguments:
- Left side: `a`
- Right side: `[a]`

This means that the left side can be of any type, while the right side is a list of elements of the same type. The type variable `a` represents any type that satisfies the condition.

### Parameterized Data Types (Motivation)

Consider the scenario where we want to define data types for trees. We may initially define separate data types for different kinds of trees, such as `IntegerTree`, `StringTree`, and `DoubleTree`. However, this leads to code duplication and limits the flexibility of our definitions.

```haskell
data IntegerTree = Empty
                 | Branch  Integer IntegerTree IntegerTree
  deriving (Eq, Show)

data StringTree = Empty
                | Branch  String StringTree StringTree
  deriving (Eq, Show)

data DoubleTree = Empty
                | Branch  Double DoubleTree DoubleTree
  deriving (Eq, Show)
```

### Parameterized Data Types (Defining)

To avoid duplication and improve code reusability, we can introduce parameterized data types. By abstracting the type of the tree nodes using a type variable, we can define a single data type called `Tree` that can accommodate different types of trees.

```haskell
data Tree a = Empty
            | Branch a (Tree a) (Tree a)
  deriving (Eq, Show)
```

Here, `Tree` is a parameterized data type, where the type variable `a` can represent any type. The `Empty` constructor represents an empty tree, while the `Branch` constructor represents a non-empty tree with a value of type `a` and two child trees of type `Tree a`.

### Parameterized Data Types (Using)

Parameterized data types allow us to write generic functions that operate on different types of trees. For example, we can define a function `treeSize` that calculates the number of nodes in a tree. It takes a `Tree a` as input and returns an `Integer`.

```haskell
treeSize :: Tree a -> Integer
treeSize Empty = 0
treeSize (Branch value left right) = 1 + treeSize left + treeSize right
```

Additionally, we can compare the sizes of two trees using the `maxTreeSize` function. It takes two `Tree` instances, `t1` and `t2`, and returns the maximum size among them.

```haskell
maxTreeSize :: Tree a -> Tree b -> Integer
maxTreeSize t1 t2 = max (treeSize t1) (treeSize t2)
```

By parameterizing our data types, we achieve code reusability and abstraction. The same functions can operate on different types of trees without the need for redundant code.

## Maybe

The Maybe type is a built-in parameterized type in Haskell. It is useful for representing the presence or absence of a value. The Maybe type is defined as follows:



```haskell
data Maybe a = Nothing
             | Just a
  deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)
```

- The `Nothing` constructor represents the absence of a value.
- The `Just` constructor wraps a value of type `a`, indicating its presence.

Maybe types are commonly used in Haskell maps, where lookup operations return a Maybe value. The `Map.lookup` function, for example, returns `Just value` if a value is found for a given key, and `Nothing` otherwise.

```haskell
initialEnv :: Env
initialEnv = Map.insert "x" 42 Map.empty

defaultLookup :: String -> Env -> Double
defaultLookup var env = case Map.lookup var env of
                          Just value -> value
                          Nothing -> 0
```

In this example, we define an initial environment (`initialEnv`) and a function (`defaultLookup`) that looks up a variable in the environment. If the variable is found (`Just value`), we return the corresponding value. If not (`Nothing`), we provide a default value of 0.

The Maybe type allows us to handle situations where values may or may not be present, providing a safe and expressive way to work with optional values in Haskell.
